 <h2> My life before Lennart </h2>
   <p> I've had lennart for 2 years and i always wanted my own pet.
     We could not get a dog because my dad is allergic and this was
     my second best choice. <br> Not for one second of my life have i regret
     gotten this beautiful lizard.
   <br> Lennart is a male bearded dragon that heritages from Australia but was born here in sweden. </p>
