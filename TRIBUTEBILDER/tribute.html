 <h2> My life before Lennart </h2>
   <p> I've always wanted a lizard for a pet,<br>my parents have turtles because my dad is allergic to cats and dogs.<br>
   I have always thought lizards were really cool and interesting,<br> And when i turned 15 i decided to start saving for one. <br>
 Less then a year later i could buy my own baby lizard.  </p>

   <h2> My life with lennart </h2>
   <p> I've had lennart for 2 years.<br> Not for one second of my life have i regret
     gotten this beautiful lizard.
   <br> Lennart is a male bearded dragon that heritages from Australia but was born here in sweden. </p>
